/*
Efficient AVR DTMF Decoding
Copyright (c) 2015, Paul Stoffregen

I originally developed this 8 bit AVR-based DTMF decoding code in 2009 for a
special one-off project.  More recently, I created a superior implementation
for 32 bit ARM Cortex-M4 in the Teensy Audio Library.

http://www.pjrc.com/teensy/td_libs_Audio.html
https://github.com/PaulStoffregen/Audio/blob/master/examples/Analysis/DialTone_Serial/DialTone_Serial.ino

I highly recommend using the 32 bit version for new projects.  However, this
old 8 bit code may still be useful for some projects.  If you use this code,
I only ask that you preserve this info and links to the newer library.
